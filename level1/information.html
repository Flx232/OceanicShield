                            The ocean is an important ecosystem that is just as vulnerable as the other ecosystems. A significant portion of the
                            oxygen we breathe is produced by plants that call home in vast oceans. Many industries and animals depends on the sea,
                            which makes cleaning the ocean a task that must start as soon as possible. Before we talk about how to clean up the ocean,
                            we need to first know what we are actually cleaning up. There are many things floating around in our oceans. Some are
                            from animals while others are man made. The problem is that our oceans are being filled with man made trash that directly
                            and indirectly harm the ecosystem. Some pollutants that will be discussed are: plastics, fertilizer overflow and oil
                            spillage.

                        <h2>Plastics</h2>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 1%; font-size:20px;">
                            Plastic has played an important part in making our lives easier. From plastic bottles to tires, whether you
                            want to admit it or not, plastic is all around us. The great thing about plastic is their ability to last a
                            long time. If you through a plastic bottle out in the streets, that bottle won't break down for a long time.
                            This durability is also a problem that is causing major environmental damage. Because plastic products can
                            come in different shapes and sizes, it's not uncommon to see animals have their stomach filled with small
                            plastic trash or get strangled or entangled by plastic bags or fish nets. Suffocation is not the only danger
                            these creatures must face. Some animals mistake plastic for food, like the sea turtle thinking plastic bags are
                            jelly fish. The plastic then gets stuck in the animal's stomach, causing them to eventually die to starvation
                            due to the brain thinking that their stomach is full. Finally, plastic products in to the ocean, are subjected to
                            the harsh rays of the sun and the waves, causing them to break down into small plastic particles that cannot be even
                            seen with the naked eye. These microplastics are so small that they can even fit inside blood vessels, which means
                            there is a possibility that our plastic products may come back to bite us.

                        <h2> Fertilizer Overflow</h2>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 1%; font-size:20px;">
                            Fertilizer is an important resource for farming. The ingredients that make up fertilizer encourages plant growth,
                            allowing farmers to grow more crops to sell. However, often times, fertilizer will be washed away when it starts
                            raining. this cause the fertilizer to flow into the rivers, which are then carried to the oceans. How does fertilizer
                            cause environmental damage? As stated before, fertilizer encourages plant growth. While it is true that seaweed is a
                            plant that grows in the ocean, it is not the only plant that benefits from this excess amounts of fertilizer runoff.
                            Microscopic single-celled plants called algae start to grow rapidly, becoming algae blooms. You may think that more
                            plants is better. However, in this situation it is not the case. Due to the rapid growth of algae, once they die, the
                            algae will release toxins, causing the animals living in the water to die.

                        <h2>Oil Spillage</h2>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 1%; font-size:20px;">
                            Oil is possible the most important commodity in the modern era. When people think of oil, they typically think of it as a
                            source of fuel. However, that is not it's only use. Oil is also used for making plastic. While oil spills themselves don't
                            occur often, when they do happen, they significantly impact the ocean's ecosystem. Oil spills only occur when there is an
                            accident, whether it's an oil drill or a large ship. It is because oil does not mix well with water that it can easily spread
                            out and effect a larger area than where the problem originated from. How does the wildlife get effected? Well I don't think
                            humans would appreciate getting dunked in crude oil or having it contaminating the water they need to survive.

                        <p style="padding-bottom: 1%; font-size:20px;">
                            After reading all this information, you must be confused on how these events, which happen mostly at sea, effect us
                            land dwellers. By causing harm to the oceanic ecosystem, we are affecting the lives of millions of people. When billions
                            of people indiscriminately throw away their plastic trash, the trash does not disappear. Eventually all the trash we
                            throw away will either be mistaken for food by other animals or cause those animals to die, severely damaging the ocean's
                            ecosystem and can potentially destroy important fishing industries. Not to mention the potential dangers of microplastics
                            in our water supply. It is not just plastic, if there is too much fertilizer run off, the ocean will become more toxic,
                            which can indirectly affect the air as well. Finally, the oil spills damage animal wildlife. The ocean provides us with an
                            abundant amount of resources. Civilizations depend on the ocean as a source of food. It is important to become the shield
                            that protects our oceans.

                        <p style="padding-bottom: 1%; font-size:20px;">
                            How can you become a shield that protects our ocean against harmful pollutants? There are many ways! In order to reduce
                            the amount of trash that enters the ocean, it is better to attack at the source. It is your responsibility to ensure that
                            you do not produce an excess amounts of trash, especially non-degradable trash. The simplest way is to use reusable products
                            instead of products designed to be thrown away once purchased. Make sure to advocate your local government to take preventative
                            measures against misusing fertilizer and promote the use of products that do not require the usage of oil. Lastly, the best
                            way to contribute towards the fight to protect our oceans is to volunteer. There are already organizations present whose sole
                            purpose is to rid our oceans and beaches from plastic litter. We must fight to maintain the beauty of the sea and to maintain
                            the amount of biodiversity for the future.
